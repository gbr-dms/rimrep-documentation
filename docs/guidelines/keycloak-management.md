## Background image update
Code for backgroun image in Keycloak login page is managed in rimrep-flux repo. Details related to background image update are captured here. Below details will help to understand how it is set-up and also to debug issues if custom background image (one with clown fish) is broken or not loading.
- Custom background image (one with clown fish) is loaded to Keycloak via themes
- A new theme called custom theme is added to keycloak and will be loaded to Keycloak container via config map
- Two files are needed for adding the background image for the custom theme, `theme.properties` and `login.css`
-  `theme.properties` is a small file with few lines explains which parent theme is used, where the base theme is imported from and the css file
-  `login.css` is the stylesheet for the custom theme. It is copied from base Keycloak theme by viewing the page source when loading keycloak login page using keycloak theme.
-  Background image and header font styles are updated in `login.css`. Lines updated are marked with a comment `/* Updated */` and `/* Added */` for future reference.
-  Once after added the theme, realm settings to be updated to use the new custom theme and can be done using `rimrep-terraform`
